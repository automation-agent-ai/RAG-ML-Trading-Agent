# ML Features Extraction Summary

## Problem Solved

We've successfully addressed the issue of extracting ML features from the DuckDB database for both training and prediction modes. The key challenges we overcame were:

1. **Ticker Format Mismatch**: We identified and fixed the mismatch between ticker formats in the `setups` table (without `.L` suffix) and the `fundamentals`/`financial_ratios` tables (with `.L` suffix).

2. **Feature Extraction**: We created robust scripts to extract both text and financial features from the database, handling various edge cases and providing detailed logging.

3. **Setup ID Management**: We developed tools to extract, filter, and subset setup IDs based on various criteria, making it easy to create training and prediction datasets.

## Scripts Created

1. **Feature Extraction Scripts**:
   - `extract_financial_features_from_duckdb.py`: Extracts financial features
   - `extract_text_features_from_duckdb.py`: Extracts text features
   - `extract_all_ml_features_from_duckdb.py`: Runs both financial and text feature extractions

2. **Setup ID Management Scripts**:
   - `extract_all_setups.py`: Extracts all setup IDs with various filtering options
   - `extract_subset_setups.py`: Creates subsets of setup IDs for processing

3. **Analysis Scripts**:
   - `analyze_financial_features.py`: Analyzes financial feature tables
   - `analyze_ml_features.py`: Analyzes both financial and text feature tables

## Results

1. **Financial Features**:
   - Successfully extracted financial features for 1000 setups
   - 288 setups (28.8%) have non-null `total_revenue` values
   - 51 financial features extracted, including raw fundamentals, financial ratios, and growth metrics
   - Created both training and prediction tables

2. **Text Features**:
   - Successfully extracted text features for 50 setups
   - 100% of setups have non-null news features
   - 96% of setups have non-null user posts and analyst features
   - 43 text features extracted, covering news, user posts, and analyst recommendations

## Usage

To extract ML features:

```bash
# Extract all features
python extract_all_ml_features_from_duckdb.py --mode training --setup-list data/fundamentals_subset_1000.txt

# Extract only financial features
python extract_all_ml_features_from_duckdb.py --mode training --setup-list data/fundamentals_subset_1000.txt --features financial

# Extract only text features
python extract_all_ml_features_from_duckdb.py --mode training --setup-list data/fundamentals_subset_1000.txt --features text
```

To extract setup IDs:

```bash
# Extract all setup IDs
python extract_all_setups.py --output data/all_setups.txt

# Extract setup IDs with fundamentals data
python extract_all_setups.py --output data/fundamentals_setups.txt --require-fundamentals

# Create a random subset of setup IDs
python extract_subset_setups.py --input data/fundamentals_setups.txt --output data/fundamentals_subset_1000.txt --limit 1000 --random
```

To analyze feature tables:

```bash
# Analyze financial features
python analyze_financial_features.py

# Analyze all ML features
python analyze_ml_features.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Engineering**: Now that we have the raw features, we can perform feature engineering to create more informative features for ML models.

2. **Model Training**: Use the extracted features to train ML models for predicting stock performance.

3. **Prediction Pipeline**: Integrate the feature extraction scripts into a complete prediction pipeline.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the feature extraction process for larger datasets and faster processing.

5. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most important features for prediction and focus on those in future iterations.
