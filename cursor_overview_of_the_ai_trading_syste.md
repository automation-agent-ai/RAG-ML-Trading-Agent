**User**

i want you to describe our complete pipeline (what we achieved) in the following context:

context:
You are a mentor at my programming school. I’m building an advanced AI-driven trading system that combines multi-domain data processing with feature extraction using embedding models and AI agents, followed by a machine learning pipeline for predictive modeling. The project involves multiple layers of automation and processing.

🧠 Overview of Workflow:
Identify New Setups

Check the setups table in the database.

For each setup, determine whether embeddings have already been generated.

Embedding Generation for New Setups

For new setups, extract all available textual content from four domains:

RNS News articles

User posts (e.g., from forums/social platforms)

Analyst recommendations

Fundamentals (converted to text format, with field names and values)

Convert this text into vector embeddings using the embedding model:
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from sentence-transformers.

Feature Extraction via Domain-Specific AI Agents

For each domain, invoke a dedicated agent:

Each agent uses a custom prompt template tailored to its content type.

The input is the embedded content for the current setup.

The agent uses a shared feature_plan to extract predefined features and returns a structured output string.

Store Features in Domain Tables

Parse each agent's output string.

Write the feature names and values into dedicated domain-specific tables:

features_rns

features_user_posts

features_analyst_rec

features_fundamentals

Next: Machine Learning Pipeline (not shown here)

The extracted features feed into a separate ML pipeline for classification or regression on trading outcomes.

I'll help you describe your complete pipeline as your mentor! Let me first examine your current implementation to understand what you've actually built.

## 🎓 **Excellent Work! Here's What You've Achieved**

As your mentor, I'm genuinely impressed with the sophisticated AI-driven trading system you've built. Let me break down the remarkable multi-layered architecture you've created:

## 🏗️ **Complete Pipeline Architecture**

### **1. Data Orchestration & Setup Management** [[memory:4469652]]
You've built a sophisticated **LangGraph-powered orchestration system** that manages the entire workflow with state-driven execution:

- **LangGraph State Management** (`orchestration/enhanced_langgraph_pipeline.py`) - Intelligent workflow routing
- **Setup Validation** - Automatically identifies new setups vs. those already processed
- **Parallel Execution Groups** - Optimizes processing by running independent stages simultaneously

### **2. Multi-Domain Data Extraction & Embedding Generation**
You've implemented a **sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline** across four data domains:

#### **🔗 Vector Embedding Pipeline**

#### **🎯 Analyst Agent** (`agents/analyst_recommendations/`)
- **Professional Analysis**: Recommendation consensus, price target analysis
- **Momentum Tracking**: Recent upgrades/downgrades, conviction scores
- **Storage**: `analyst_recommendations_features` table (15 professional insight features)

### **4. Sophisticated Feature Engineering** [[memory:4458192]]
You've created a **comprehensive feature plan** (`features/feature_plan.md`) with:

- **138 total features** across all domains
- **Mixed feature types**: Numeric, categorical, boolean, text arrays

**User**

this is not my final repo, but my final repo is similar. it has a pipeline documentation called "Optimized_Workflow.md".
only difference is that there are additional step in the pipeline to save trained embeddings for defined setup_id for prediction, and then re-embed those setup_id (without labels) and make similarity search to get similar embeddings from the training data (with label) and then the agent (gpt-4o-mini) has context to make a prediction (few-shot system).

now given your architecture description: how can i formulate a cursor prompt, so it takes your description as a baseline and then modifies according to the steps (and according to the optimized_workflow.md) i just explained to you?

goal is again to get a great presentation of my project. especially following (but not limited to it!) should be explained:
DB-Storage
Embedding Converion -> LanceDB
Prompt-Engineering especially for LLM-Agent-Calls for feature extractoin
Prompt-Engineering for similarity search and agent prediction
Features Pre-Processing for Machine Learning
ML-Training (Explainable AI – - > Basic Form Chain-of-Thought variables)
Evaluation/Visualization
