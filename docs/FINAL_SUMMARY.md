# Enhanced RAG Pipeline - Final Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Fixed LanceDB Directory Structure**
   - Consolidated all LanceDB tables in the root `lancedb_store` directory
   - Removed redundant `data/lancedb_store` directory
   - Ensured agents use consistent paths to access LanceDB tables

2. **Fixed ML Feature Merger**
   - Updated `core/ml_feature_merger.py` to always use the main database for both training and prediction modes
   - Ensured feature tables are correctly found and merged

3. **Added Sample Data**
   - Created `add_sample_data.py` to add test data for setup ID `AFN_2023-11-20`
   - Added sample RNS announcements and stock news

4. **Fixed Similarity Search**
   - Ensured the news agent correctly finds similar cases in the training embeddings
   - Successfully generated similarity predictions for the news domain

5. **End-to-End Pipeline**
   - Pipeline now runs successfully in prediction mode
   - Creates embeddings for news, fundamentals, analyst recommendations, and user posts
   - Extracts features from available data
   - Generates similarity predictions for domains with data
   - Stores predictions in the `similarity_predictions` table
   - Creates ML feature tables for both text and financial features

## What Still Needs Attention

1. **Missing Data for Some Domains**
   - Fundamentals data is missing for the test setup ID
   - Analyst recommendations data is missing for the test setup ID
   - User posts data is missing for the test setup ID

2. **Error Handling in Agents**
   - The analyst recommendations agent fails with `'recommendation_count'` error when no data is found
   - Need to add better error handling for missing data

3. **Similarity Predictions for All Domains**
   - Currently, only the news domain generates similarity predictions
   - Need to ensure all domains can generate predictions when data is available

4. **Training Embeddings with Labels**
   - Need to ensure training embeddings include performance labels for better similarity predictions
   - Create a process to periodically update training embeddings with new labeled data

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Sample Data**
   - Add sample data for fundamentals, analyst recommendations, and user posts
   - Ensure the sample data has the correct schema

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Update agents to handle missing data gracefully
   - Add more robust error handling for edge cases

3. **Enhance Similarity Features**
   - Add more sophisticated similarity features
   - Improve the prediction algorithm to consider more factors

4. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the enhanced RAG pipeline
   - Include examples of how to use it in different scenarios

5. **Testing**
   - Create automated tests for the pipeline
   - Test with a variety of setup IDs and data scenarios

## Conclusion

The enhanced RAG pipeline is now working correctly and can generate similarity predictions for domains with available data. The ML feature merger correctly creates feature tables for both text and financial features. The pipeline is ready for further testing and refinement.
