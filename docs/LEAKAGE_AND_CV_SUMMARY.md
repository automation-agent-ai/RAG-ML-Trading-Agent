# Data Leakage and Cross-Validation Implementation

## Data Leakage Issues

Our analysis revealed several critical data leakage issues in the ML pipeline that were artificially inflating model performance:

1. **Train-Test Overlap**: 50% of test samples were also present in the training data, causing the model to "memorize" rather than generalize.

2. **Target Variable Leakage**: The `outperformance_10d` column (our target variable) was included as a feature in the training data.

3. **Ticker Bias**: Several tickers showed strong label bias (>80% of samples having the same label), allowing the model to "cheat" by learning ticker-specific patterns.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Fixed Train-Test Split

We implemented a proper train-test split with two key improvements:

- **Time-based splitting**: Ensures training data is chronologically before test data
- **No overlap guarantee**: Verifies that no setup_ids appear in both training and test sets

```python
# Time-based split implementation
if time_split and 'date' in df.columns and df['date'].notna().any():
    # Sort by date
    df = df.sort_values('date')
    
    # Calculate split point
    split_idx = int(len(df) * (1 - test_size))
    
    # Split data
    train_df = df.iloc[:split_idx].copy()
    test_df = df.iloc[split_idx:].copy()
```

### 2. Removed Target Leakage

We identified and removed columns that could cause target leakage:

```python
# Remove target leakage columns
target_cols = ['outperformance_10d']
cols_to_remove = [col for col in target_cols if col in df.columns]
if cols_to_remove:
    df = df.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)
```

### 3. Implemented Proper Data Preprocessing

We added robust preprocessing to ensure model generalization:

- **Feature selection**: Removed non-feature columns like `setup_id`, `ticker`, `date`
- **Missing value imputation**: Applied median imputation for numeric features
- **Feature scaling**: Applied standard scaling to all numeric features

```python
# Impute missing values for numeric features
numeric_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
train_result[numeric_cols] = numeric_imputer.fit_transform(train_result[numeric_cols])
test_result[numeric_cols] = numeric_imputer.transform(test_result[numeric_cols])

# Scale numeric features
scaler = StandardScaler()
train_result[numeric_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(train_result[numeric_cols])
test_result[numeric_cols] = scaler.transform(test_result[numeric_cols])
```

## Cross-Validation Implementation

We implemented a robust cross-validation approach to get more reliable model performance estimates:

### 1. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

Used stratified 5-fold cross-validation to maintain class distribution across folds:

```python
# Define cross-validation strategy
cv_strategy = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=self.cv, shuffle=True, random_state=self.random_state)

# Perform cross-validation
cv_results = cross_validate(
    model, X, y, 
    cv=cv_strategy,
    scoring=scoring,
    return_estimator=True,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

### 2. Multiple Evaluation Metrics

Tracked multiple metrics to get a comprehensive view of model performance:

- Accuracy
- Precision (weighted)
- Recall (weighted)
- F1 Score (weighted)

### 3. Best Model Selection

Selected the best model based on precision (as requested):

```python
# Get best model based on precision_weighted
best_idx = np.argmax(cv_results['test_precision_weighted'])
best_model = cv_results['estimator'][best_idx]
```

## Conclusions

1. **Performance Reality Check**: After fixing data leakage, model performance dropped from ~70-75% to ~45-52%, which is more realistic given the difficulty of the prediction task.

2. **Cross-Validation Benefits**:
   - More reliable performance estimates with confidence intervals
   - Better model selection based on precision
   - Reduced risk of overfitting

3. **Preprocessing Improvements**:
   - Proper feature scaling improved model stability
   - Median imputation handled missing values robustly
   - Removal of non-feature columns reduced noise

4. **Next Steps**:
