# Enhanced RAG Pipeline Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Implemented Training/Prediction Mode Separation**
   - Created a `BaseEmbedder` class that all embedders inherit from
   - Added `mode` parameter to all embedders and agents
   - Ensured labels are only included in training mode
   - Ensured embeddings are not stored in prediction mode

2. **Added Similarity Search Capability**
   - Implemented `find_similar_training_embeddings` method in all agents
   - Added `compute_similarity_features` to extract features from similar cases
   - Implemented `predict_via_similarity` for direct prediction based on similarity

3. **Created Pipeline Orchestration**
   - Enhanced `CompletePipeline` to support training and prediction modes
   - Added `_store_similarity_predictions` to store predictions in DuckDB
   - Created a robust system for checking and storing similarity predictions

4. **Added Sample Data for Testing**
   - Created `add_sample_data.py` to add test data for a setup ID
   - Added RNS announcements and stock news for testing

5. **Fixed Issues**
   - Fixed DuckDB table and column name issues in embedders
   - Fixed LanceDB path mismatches
   - Added robust error handling for missing tables
   - Fixed import issues and added missing imports

## Answers to Specific Questions

### Is the Pipeline Extracting Features and Creating ML Feature Tables?

Yes, the pipeline is designed to extract features and create ML feature tables, but there are some issues:

1. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - The pipeline successfully extracts features from the news domain
   - It attempts to extract features from fundamentals, analyst recommendations, and user posts domains
   - However, due to schema mismatches or missing data, some domains fail to extract features

2. **ML Feature Tables**:
   - The pipeline tries to create four main ML feature tables:
     - `text_ml_features_training` / `text_ml_features_prediction`
     - `financial_ml_features_training` / `financial_ml_features_prediction`
   - However, the ML feature merger reports that the source tables (`news_features`, `userposts_features`, etc.) are missing
   - This indicates that while the agents are extracting features, they're not correctly storing them in the expected tables

### Financial Feature Processing

The financial feature processing is designed to:

1. **Extract Historical Data**: 
   - The `FundamentalsEmbedderDuckDB` is designed to fetch the last 4 years of balance sheet information prior to the setup date
   - This is visible in the SQL query in `embed_fundamentals_duckdb.py` where it joins with the `setups` table and filters by date

2. **Calculate Growth Ratios**: 
   - The `MLFeatureMerger` in `core/ml_feature_merger.py` calculates growth ratios like:
     - Revenue growth YoY
     - Net income growth YoY
     - Operating cash flow growth YoY
     - EBITDA growth YoY
   - It does this by comparing current values with values from the previous year

3. **Preprocessing Steps**:
   - The pipeline doesn't currently implement imputation and transformation steps
   - These would need to be added as additional preprocessing steps before ML model training
   - The current focus is on feature extraction and similarity-based prediction

## What Still Needs to Be Fixed

1. **Table Schema Issues**
   - The `analyst_recommendations` table schema doesn't match what's expected in the code
   - The `user_posts` table schema doesn't match what's expected in the code
   - Need to update either the table schemas or the code to match

2. **Feature Table Creation**
   - The feature tables (`news_features`, `userposts_features`, etc.) are not being correctly populated
   - The ML feature merger is not finding the feature tables

3. **Missing Fundamentals Data**
   - The fundamentals data is not being correctly loaded or processed
   - Need to fix the schema or data loading in `FundamentalsEmbedderDuckDB`

4. **Missing Labels in Similar Cases**
   - The similar cases found don't have `outperformance_10d` labels
   - Need to ensure training embeddings include labels

5. **Improve Sample Data**
   - Add more comprehensive sample data for all domains
   - Ensure sample data has the correct schema

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Table Schemas**
   - Update the table schemas to match what's expected in the code
   - Or update the code to match the existing table schemas

2. **Add Training Embeddings with Labels**
   - Create training embeddings with proper labels
   - Ensure they're stored in the correct LanceDB tables

3. **Test Complete Pipeline**
   - Test the pipeline with both training and prediction modes
   - Verify that similarity predictions are being generated correctly

4. **Add Documentation**
   - Document the enhanced RAG pipeline
   - Add examples of how to use it

5. **Add More Sophisticated Features**
   - Enhance the similarity features
   - Add more advanced prediction methods
